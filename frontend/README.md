# Work It Out
CRUD for your workout tracking.

This started as a project for CS 290, Web Programming, Fall term 2022 at Oregon State University. I used ReactJS, MongoDB, and Express to develop a Web application that allows saving and editing input. It's become a useful toy project for testing out other Web development techniques.

Developer: Melanie Archer, archemel@oregonstate.edu

## Installation and starting

In the `backend` directory, run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

In the `frontend` directory, run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
