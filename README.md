# Work It Out
CRUD for your workout tracking.

This started as a project for Web Programming, Fall term 2022 at Oregon State University. I used ReactJS, MongoDB, and Express to develop a Web application that allows saving and editing input. It's become a useful toy project for testing out other Web development techniques.
